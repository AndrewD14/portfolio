            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Andrew is an accomplished software developer. He wanted to get into programming, because he found the idea of a computer taking a bunch of 0's and 1's and turning it into what gets displayed on the screen to be fascinating.</p>
            <p>He first started to program his sophmore year of high school with Visual Basic and Java. He then expanded his knowledge of computers by taking A+ and Net+ certification courses. He has built several computers and repairs them for his friends and family. His most recent build has water cooling inside.</p>
            <p>When Andrew went off to college, he continue to focus on computers, but narrowed his attention to software development. He completed his associates at Harper College with an A gpa and moved on to DeVry where he earned his Bachelors in Computer Science. Later, while working at Northwestern, he would expand on on skills with completing the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>In his free time, Andrew continues to research and teach himself new skills and programming languages. One day, he plans to start an online collaborate coding lesson twitch channel to help others learn how to create web applications and provide a way for other developers to join in sharing their knowledge.</p>
            <p>While Andrew is relaxing, he enjoys online video games and hanging out with his twin brother. He has earned the rank of Eagle Scout.</p>
